How to create a newsletter for a new quarter.

1. Create a directory for the new quarter in public/labs/labsreport.
e.g. mkdir public/labs/labsreport/2016-Qtest

2. Create file data.json to cover your data. Keep the keys the same as the ones of other quarters.

3. Create directories 2016-Qtest/images and 2016-Qtest/images/contributors. Trace of images is:
top10apps.png and overallAdoption.png -> 2016-Qtest/images
portraits of topCeeContributors -> 2016-Qtest/images/contributors.

4. Add a new list item to public/labs/labsreport/index.html
